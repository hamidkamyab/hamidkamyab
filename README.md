I am a full-stack developer who entered the world of programming in 2015 🚀. Currently, I work with Node.js and the Nest.js framework for backend development 🛠️, as well as Next.js and React for frontend development 💻.

Although I don’t have extensive experience yet, I am passionate about continuously improving my skills 🌱. In the past, I have also worked with PHP, and I am currently employed as a frontend developer at a payment service provider company 💳.

When it comes to UI design, I am fully familiar with CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS and Bootstrap 🎨. I also have experience working with Docker 🐳. My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering 🎓. 😊
